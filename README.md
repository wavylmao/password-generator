# Setup for local development

Clone to a local directory. If you are using VSCode, I recommend using the GitLens extension for quick access. Otherwise, just use the terminal.

For terminal: 

```
git clone https://github.com/wavylmao/password-generator.git

cd password-generator
```

For VSCode/GitLens:

To install required dependencies and start app on port 8080, run the following commands in the terminal.

```
npm install

npm start
```

You can now find this app running on localhost:8080!
